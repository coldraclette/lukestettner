  description:
    "Luke Stettner explores a range of experimental strategies in his photography and sculpture. He uses highly technical processes to create images and juxtaposes them with avant-garde language and concrete poetry. Stettner's work is invested in poetics, employing words to evoke both form and feelingâ€”while still acknowledging that the meaning of any image is made by the viewer.",
